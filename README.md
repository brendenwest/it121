#### Summary

This class covers the core features of JavaScript, the primary web development programming language. Students will write increasingly complex programs to exercise key web development concepts including forms validation, API requests, & animations.

Throughout the course we will use common tools and techniques of professional web developers, such as source control, browser debuggers, and dependency management. All assignments will be turned in via github.com, a source-control system used widely in professional software development.

**Note**: Students should be familiar with HTML, DOM, basic computer programming, and computer usage.

#### Required Materials

This course will reference **JavaScript from Beginner to Professional** (Packt Publishing), which  students can access free of charge online through - https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/temporary-access/?orpq

Students will also need the following free resources:

* A https://replit.com account
* A https://github.com account
* The git client software, installed on your development computer.
* A modern, syntax-highlighting code editor.

### Class Structure and Topics

Each week, we'll cover a different topic, building on the previous week's work. In general, I will post new material on Monday and review in depth on Thursday, allowing time for questions and in-person demos.

The class will cover the following topics, although the order and precise list is subject to revision:

- Basic JavaScript language programming
- HTML DOM manipulation with JQuery
- Forms & data validation
- DOM events & effects
- API integration
- Drawing

### Grading

Grades will be based on weekly assignments posted on Canvas each Monday and  designed to exercise the skills and concepts covered that week. Assignments are due by the end of the week, and late assignments will be automatically marked down by 10%.

You may discuss how to approach a problem with other students in the class, but your submission must be your own work. Code submissions that are substantially identical would be considered cheating and subject to a markdown penalty.
